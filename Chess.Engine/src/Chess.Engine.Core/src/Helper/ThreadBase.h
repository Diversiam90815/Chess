/**
 * @class ThreadBase
 * @brief Lightweight base class that encapsulates a single worker thread whose execution loop is implemented by a derived class via run().
 *
 * The class offers:
 *  - Deterministic start / stop lifecycle (idempotent).
 *  - Event based wake-up via a condition variable (@see triggerEvent()).
 *  - A helper wait method (@see waitForEvent()) to block until an event or shutdown.
 *
 * Typical usage pattern (cooperative loop):
 * @code
 * class Worker final : public ThreadBase
 * {
 *     void run() override
 *     {
 *         while (isRunning())
 *         {
 *             // Block until an external event (triggerEvent) OR stop() is called.
 *             if (waitForEvent(2000))   // optional timeout (ms)
 *             {
 *                 // Process signaled work here
 *             }
 *             // Optional periodic work when no event within timeout
 *         }
 *         // Cleanup before thread exits if needed
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * Worker w;
 * w.start();
 * // ... later
 * w.triggerEvent();    // Wake the worker to process something
 * // ... later
 * w.stop();            // Graceful join
 * @endcode
 *
 * Thread-safety:
 *  - Public methods are thread-safe unless otherwise noted.
 *  - Do not call stop() from within the worker thread itself (would attempt a self join).
 *
 * Lifetime:
 *  - The derived object must outlive the internal thread (stop() before destruction).
 *
 * @warning Calling stop() from inside run() will deadlock (self-join). Instead, let run()
 *          exit naturally by observing isRunning().
 *
 * @note start() and stop() are idempotent; redundant calls are cheap no-ops.
