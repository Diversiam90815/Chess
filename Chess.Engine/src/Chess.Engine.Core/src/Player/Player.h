/**
 * @brief	Immutable pairing of a player color with a numeric evaluation (material or aggregate).
 *
 * Semantics:
 *  - Represents ONLY the numeric value; it does not auto-update. Owning code is responsible
 *    for recomputation (e.g., after captures) and replacing the value via Player::setScore().
 *  - Value convention: positive magnitudes only (sign not used to distinguish players; the
 *    PlayerColor field does that explicitly).
 *
 * Usage Patterns:
 *  - Stored inside Player for quick retrieval and UI display.
 *  - Can be compared directly with another Score (same color + value).
 *
 * Invariants:
 *  - `player` is always a valid PlayerColor (may be NoColor before initialization).
 *  - `value` is non-negative (not enforced programmatically; callers should avoid negatives).

/**
 * @brief	Lightweight aggregation of per-player state (material score, captured pieces,
 *			color assignment, local/remote designation).
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *  - Maintain incremental material score (updated via 'updateScore()' after captures).
 *  - Track captured opponent pieces for UI / analytics.
 *  - Distinguish local vs remote (used by multiplayer logic / input gating).
 *
 * Design Notes:
 *  - Score is stored as a 'Score' domain object (supports color association).
 *  - Does not enforce turn ownership; that is orchestrated by StateMachine.
